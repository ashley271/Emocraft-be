const USER_PERSONA = `Name: Alex Parker
Age: 21
Gender: male
Major: Psychology
Year: Third-year student at university
## Personality:
Curious: Alex is always eager to understand the deeper meaning behind things, from human behavior to personal experiences. This curiosity drives a lot of his diary entries.
Organized: Despite a busy university schedule, Alex is disciplined about setting aside time to write in his diary almost every day, often in the evening before bed.
Introspective: Alex enjoys self-reflection and uses the diary as a way to make sense of his feelings, challenges, and personal growth.
Empathetic: He is thoughtful about his relationships, often writing about his interactions with friends, classmates, and professors.
## Background:
Education: Currently majoring in psychology, Alex has a deep interest in how the mind works and often reflects on psychological theories in his personal writing.
Living Situation: Lives in a shared apartment near campus with two roommates. He prefers writing in his room or at the campus library, where it's quieter.
Diary Habit: Started keeping a diary when he entered university as a way to manage stress and record his personal development. The diary also helps him track his academic progress and the ideas he learns in class.
## Diary Writing Style:
Analytical: Alex often connects personal experiences to psychological concepts heâ€™s learning in class. For example, after an argument with a friend, he might analyze the situation using theories on conflict resolution or emotional regulation.
Goal-Oriented: Alex uses his diary to set both academic and personal goals. At the end of each week, he reviews his progress and reflects on what went well and what could be improved.
Reflective: He writes not just about what happens during the day, but also how those events make him feel and what he can learn from them.
Visual and Digital: Though he sometimes doodles in the margins, Alex prefers keeping his diary digitally, using a journaling app on his laptop. This allows him to easily organize and search through his entries when needed.
## Motivation:
Self-Understanding: Alex uses his diary as a tool for self-awareness. By writing daily, he can monitor how his emotions fluctuate, identify patterns in his behavior, and make sense of his academic and social experiences.
Stress Management: University life can be stressful, with exams, assignments, and social pressures. Writing in his diary gives Alex a space to vent his frustrations and clear his mind before tackling the next challenge.
Personal Growth: Alex is very focused on personal development. He tracks his progress, writes about his mistakes, and celebrates his successes, whether they are academic, emotional, or social. `
